# iRODS HTTP API

A project that presents an iRODS Zone as HTTP v1.1.

![iRODS HTTP API network diagram - HTTP Basic Authentication](http_api_diagram-basic_auth.png)

## Quickstart (Running from Docker Hub Image)

Generate a local configuration JSON file.

```
docker run --rm irods/irods_http_api --dump-config-template > config.json
```

Edit/update the template `config.json` file (point to your iRODS Zone, remove OIDC and TLS sections, etc.).

```
vim config.json
```

Launch the HTTP API with your customized configuration file to check for success/errors.

```
docker run --rm --name irods_http_api \
    -v ./config.json:/config.json:ro \
    -p 9000:9000 \
    irods/irods_http_api
```

Then, the HTTP API will be available.

```
$ curl -X POST -u rods:rods \
    http://localhost:9000/irods-http-api/<version>/authenticate
568bbfc2-7d19-4723-b659-bb9325f9b076

$ curl -s http://localhost:9000/irods-http-api/<version>/collections \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer 568bbfc2-7d19-4723-b659-bb9325f9b076' \
    --data-urlencode 'op=stat' \
    --data-urlencode 'lpath=/tempZone/home/rods' -G | jq

## Documentation

API documentation can be found in [API.md](./API.md).

## Build Dependencies

- iRODS development package _(4.3.2 or later)_
- iRODS externals package for boost
- iRODS externals package for nlohmann-json
- iRODS externals package for spdlog 
- Curl development package
- OpenSSL development package

## Build

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As documented under [Build Dependencies](#build-dependencies), the minimum version requirement for the iRODS development package is 4.3.2 or later. As a result, support for the [GenQuery2 API plugin](https://github.com/irods/irods_api_plugin_genquery2) has been removed. To use GenQuery2, the iRODS HTTP API must be connected to a server running iRODS 4.3.2 or later.

To build this project, follow the normal CMake build steps.
```bash
mkdir build # Preferably outside of the repository
cd build
cmake /path/to/repository
make package # Use -j to use more parallelism.
```

Upon success, you should have an installable package.

## Docker

This project provides two types of Dockerfiles, some for building packages on various operating systems, and one for running the application.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All commands in the sections that follow assume you are located in the root of the repository.

### The Builder Image

The builder image is responsible for building the iRODS HTTP API package. Before you can use it, you must build the image. To do that, run the following:
```bash
docker build -t irods-http-api-builder -f irods_builder.ub22.Dockerfile .
```

The builder image defaults to installing the development packages of the minimum supported iRODS version, 4.3.2. To install a later version of the development packages, set the `irods_version` parameter. The following is an example which demonstrates building the builder with development packages for iRODS 5.0.1.
```bash
docker build -t irods-http-api-builder -f irods_builder.ub22.Dockerfile --build-arg 'irods_version=5.0.1-0~jammy' .
```

> [!Note]
> Using updated iRODS packages can sometimes resolve compatibility issues. This is particularly true when the client is built against a version of iRODS which is older than the iRODS server which it is connecting to.

With the builder image in hand, all that's left is to build the iRODS HTTP API project. The builder image is designed to compile code sitting on your machine. This is important because it gives you the ability to build any fork or branch of the project. **Keep in mind the [GenQuery2 API plugin](https://github.com/irods/irods_api_plugin_genquery2) is no longer supported.**

Building the package requires mounting the project into the container at the appropriate location. The command you run should look similar to the one below. **Don't forget to create the directory which will hold your packages!**
```bash
docker run -it --rm \
    -v /path/to/irods_client_http_api:/http_api_source:ro \
    -v /path/to/packages_directory:/packages_output \
    irods-http-api-builder
```

If everything succeeds, you will have a DEB package in the local directory you mapped to **/packages_output**.

### The Runner Image

The runner image is responsible for running the iRODS HTTP API. Building the runner image requires the DEB package for the iRODS HTTP API to exist on the local machine. See the previous section for details on generating the package.

To build the image, run the following command:
```bash
docker build -t irods-http-api-runner \
    -f irods_runner.Dockerfile \
    /path/to/packages/directory
```

If all goes well, you will have a containerized iRODS HTTP API server! You can verify this by checking the version information. Below is an example.
```bash
$ docker run -it --rm irods-http-api-runner -v
irods_http_api v<version>-<build_sha>
```

### Launching the Container

To run the containerized server, you need to provide a configuration file at the correct location. If you do not have a configuration file already, see [Configuration](#configuration) for details.

To launch the server, run the following command:
```bash
docker run -d --rm --name irods_http_api \
    -v /path/to/config/file:/config.json:ro \
    -p 9000:9000 \
    irods-http-api-runner
```

The first thing the server will do is validate the configuration. If the configuration fails validation, the server will exit immediately. If the configuration passes validation, then congratulations, you now have a working iRODS HTTP API server!

You can view the log output using `docker logs -f` or by passing `-it` to `docker run` instead of `-d`.

If for some reason the default schema file is not sufficient, you can instruct the iRODS HTTP API to use a different schema file. See the following example.
```bash
# Generate the default JSON schema.
docker run -it --rm irods-http-api-runner --dump-default-jsonschema > schema.json

# Tweak the schema.
vim schema.json

# Launch the server with the new schema file.
docker run -d --rm --name irods_http_api \
    -v /path/to/config/file:/config.json:ro \
    -v ./schema.json:/jsonschema.json:ro \
    -p 9000:9000 \
    irods-http-api-runner \
    --jsonschema-file /jsonschema.json
```

### Stopping the Container

If the container was launched with `-it`, use **CTRL-C** or `docker container stop <container_name>` to shut it down.

If the container was launched with `-d`, use `docker container stop <container_name>`.

## Configuration

Before you can run the server, you'll need to create a configuration file.

You can generate a configuration file by running the following:
```bash
irods_http_api --dump-config-template > config.json
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `--dump-config-template` does not produce a fully working configuration. It must be updated before it can be used.

### Configuration File Structure

The JSON structure below represents the default configuration.

Notice how some of the configuration values are wrapped in angle brackets (e.g. `"<string>"`). These are placeholder values that must be updated before launch.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The comments in the JSON structure are there for explanatory purposes and must not be included in your configuration. Failing to follow this requirement will result in the server failing to start up.

## Run

To run the server, do the following:
```bash
irods_http_api /path/to/config.json
```

To stop the server, you can use **CTRL-C** or send **SIGINT** or **SIGTERM** to the process.

## OpenID Connect

![iRODS HTTP API network diagram - OpenID Connect](http_api_diagram-openid_connect.png)

Some additional configuration is required to run the OpenID Connect portion of the HTTP API.
Following are a few points of interest.

### OpenID Provider Requirements and HTTP API Configuration

The OpenID Provider, at this moment, must support discovery via a well-known endpoint.
The URL to the OpenID Provider must be specified in the `provider_url` OIDC configuration parameter.

One should take care to ensure that `/.well-known/openid-configuration` is not included
in the configuration parameter, as this is included automatically.

The OpenID Provider must be running prior to starting the HTTP API server, otherwise, the HTTP API server
will not be able to query the required information from the desired OpenID Provider.

### Mapping OpenID Users to iRODS

Before you can use OpenID with iRODS, you must enable one of the two shipped plugins, or develop your own to suit your specific needs.

#### Local File plugin

Within the `user_mapping` stanza, set `plugin_path` to the absolute path of `libirods_http_api_plugin-local_file.so`.
On most Linux-based systems, the HTTP API user mapping plugins will be installed under `/usr/lib/irods_http_api/plugins/user_mapping`.

This plugin allows for the defining of mappings of iRODS users based on desired attributes.
The attributes specified within the file can be updated, and the plugin will reload the file
to update the mappings without having to restart the server.

##### Configuration

The required configuration for this plugin is as follows:

```json
"configuration": {
    "file_path": "/path/to/file.json"
}
```

Where `file_path` is the full path to a JSON file containing the mapping of desired attributes to an iRODS user.
An example of what the JSON file can contain is as follows:

```json
{
    "alice": {
        "email": "alice@example.org",
        "sub": "123-abc-456-xyz"
    },
    "bob": {
        "email": "bob@example.org",
        "phone": "56709"
    }
}
```

#### User Claim plugin

Within the `user_mapping` stanza, set `plugin_path` to the absolute path of `libirods_http_api_plugin-user_claim.so`.
On most Linux-based systems, the HTTP API user mapping plugins will be installed under `/usr/lib/irods_http_api/plugins/user_mapping`.

This plugin looks for a claim that provides a direct mapping of an authenticated OpenID user to an iRODS user.
This requires that you have the ability to add a claim within the OpenID Provider.

##### Configuration

The configuration for this plugin is as follows:

```json
"configuration": {
    "irods_user_claim": "claim_to_map_user"
}
```

In this particular example, `claim_to_map_user` is the claim that maps the OpenID user to an iRODS user.

### Plugin Development

To develop your own plugin, make sure to conform to the plugin interface defined in [interface.h](./plugins/user_mapping/include/irods/http_api/plugins/user_mapping/interface.h).
Further documentation on the interface functions are within the file.

## Secure Communication (SSL/TLS)

The HTTP API does not handle SSL/TLS termination itself. Deployments should plan to provide a reverse proxy to handle SSL/TLS termination _in front of_ the HTTP API for secure communication with the client.

Popular proxy servers include nginx, Apache httpd, and HAProxy.
