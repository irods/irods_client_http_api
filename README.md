# iRODS HTTP API

A project that presents an iRODS 4.3.1+ server as HTTP v1.1.

## Build Dependencies

- iRODS development package
- iRODS externals package for boost
- iRODS externals package for nlohmann-json
- iRODS externals package for spdlog 
- Curl development package
- OpenSSL development package
- GenQuery2 package (optional)

## Build

This project can be built with or without support for [GenQuery2](https://github.com/irods/irods_api_plugin_genquery2).

GenQuery2 is disabled by default.

### Building without GenQuery2

If you don't need support for GenQuery2, follow the normal CMake steps.

```bash
mkdir build # Preferably outside of the repository
cd build
cmake /path/to/repository
make package # Use -j to use more parallelism.
```

Upon success, you should have an installable package.

### Building with GenQuery2

To build with GenQuery2 enabled, the HTTP API needs access to files only provided by the GenQuery2 package.

If you haven't already done so, install the GenQuery2 package. See the [GenQuery2](https://github.com/irods/irods_api_plugin_genquery2) repository for details on how to do that.

Now, run the following steps to produce an installable package.

```bash
mkdir build # Preferably outside of the repository
cd build
cmake -DIRODS_ENABLE_GENQUERY2=YES /path/to/repository
make package # Use -j to use more parallelism.
```

Keep in mind that even though you've compiled the HTTP API with support for GenQuery2, that is half the story. You must also install the GenQuery2 package on the iRODS server which the HTTP API will connect to and the iRODS Catalog Service Provider.

## Configuration

Before you can run the server, you'll need to create a configuration file.

You can generate a configuration file by running the following:
```bash
irods_http_api --dump-config-template > config.json
```

**IMPORTANT: `--dump-config-template` does not produce a fully working configuration. It must be updated before it can be used.**

### Configuration File Structure

The JSON structure below represents the default configuration.

Notice how some of the configuration values are wrapped in angle brackets (e.g. `"<string>"`). These are placeholder values that must be updated before launch.

**IMPORTANT: The comments in the JSON structure are there for explanatory purposes and must not be included in your configuration. Failing to follow this requirement will result in the server failing to start up.**
